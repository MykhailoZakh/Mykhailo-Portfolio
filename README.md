# Mykhailo-Portfolio

Making portfolio with my info and info of the projects I  did in the course.

## Description

I made a new website with my information and the work I have done during my PENN BootCamp. I wanted to present my information in responsive layout, also wanted to add some visual effects for My Work boxes. Also I wanted to make a work boxes that lead to the deployed web application after I click on them.
